The project focuses on assessing and enhancing models that predict diseases using input data. Here are the main requirements :

1. Jupyter Notebook :
   - The `.ipynb` file should illustrate the complete workflow, covering model evaluation, optimization, and results.
   - It must feature clear and descriptive outputs, including metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and visualizations to showcase the model's performance.
   - Comments and markdown cells are necessary for better readability and explanation.

2. Python Script :
   - The `.py` file should encapsulate all essential parts of the project code in a standalone format.
   - This file is crucial for users who prefer executing the code outside the notebook environment.



Features of the Submitted Project:

1. The project files exhibit a well-defined structure for evaluating machine learning models.
2. The inclusion of both `.ipynb` and `.py` formats offers flexibility for review and execution.
3. The notebook likely contains intermediate outputs and visualizations that are vital for comprehending the project flow.
4. The script file guarantees reproducibility and portability.
